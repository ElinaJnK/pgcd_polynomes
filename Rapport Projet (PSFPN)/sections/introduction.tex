\section{Introduction}

The objective of this project is to develop and implement an efficient algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two polynomials on the finite field Fp = Z/pZ. The implementation will be compared to the GCD implementations in the FLINT and NTL software libraries, which provide efficient computation on a finite field Fp = Z/pZ for univariate polynomials, particularly when p has a good root of unity that enables fast Fourier transform (FFT). Given that the GCD is used in various operations, optimizing its computation is crucial for improving efficiency. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the variant algorithm, we aim to optimize specific parts of the existing implementation.
